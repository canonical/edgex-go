# TODO for Delhi: use upstream vault config file and process it
# using sed
# this file maintains a number of changes, i.e. all
# hostnames are localhost instead of the docker hostnames, 
# the tls cert and key files reference localhost as the common name,
# and the location of the files uses reference to SNAP_DATA
# (but note that these paths have to be absolute, so we process the env
#  vars during the install hook)
